    <p id="abouttext"> Since 1888, the National Geographic Society has driven impact by identifying and investing in an international community of Explorers: leading scientists, educators, storytellers, conservationists, technologists, and many other changemakers who help us define some of the critical challenges of our time, drive new knowledge, advance new solutions, and inspire positive transformative change.
    <br> 
    <br>
        Since awarding our first grant in 1890, we have provided more than 14,000 grants for work across all seven continents. This includes the most comprehensive scientific expedition to Mount Everest, working to better understand human-carnivore conflict in Gorongosa, telling stories that help explain the world and all that’s in it, and groundbreaking work that has transformed our understanding of the great apes and what it means to be human.
        <br>
        <br>
        We also engage audiences around the globe through signature experiences, stories, and content, including the National Geographic Museum at our headquarters in Washington, D.C.

              On the night of December 10, 1999, the Philippine island of Luzon, home to the capital, Manila, and some 40 million people, abruptly lost power, sparking fears that a long-rumored military coup d’état was underway. Malls full of Christmas shoppers plunged into darkness. Holiday parties ground to a halt.

                 <p class="blocktext">Agricultural methods have intensified continuously ever since the Industrial Revolution, and even more so since the “green revolution” in the middle decades of the 20th century. At each stage, innovations in farming techniques brought about huge increases in crop yields by area of arable land.
